![PwC Logo](https://github.com/Gtshivanand/PwC-Switzerland---Power-BI-Job-Simulation/blob/main/PwC-PricewaterhouseCoopers.jpg)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Power BI projects completed as part of the **PwC Switzerland - Power BI Job Simulation** through [**Forage**](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg). This simulation provides hands-on experience in solving real-world business challenges such as customer retention, call center performance, and diversity & inclusion initiatives using Power BI.
By participating in this simulation, I developed key competencies in:

- Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Defining and analyzing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Data-driven decision-making
- Analytical thinking and storytelling with data

The simulation is divided into three different very insightful projects:
1. **Call Center Trends Analysis**: Visualizing customer satisfaction and agent performance.
2. **Customer Retention Analysis**: Identifying key metrics to predict customer churn and improve loyalty.
3. **Diversity & Inclusion Analysis**: Tracking and improving gender balance at the executive level.

## üìä Task 1: Customer Retention & Churn Dashboard

This dashboard focuses on analyzing customer retention for a telecom company. It provides actionable insights to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.

### Key Insights:

- **Service-Related Insights:**
  - Customers using "Fiber Optic" services exhibit a **higher churn rate** than those using "DSL".
  - Customers with multiple line services are more likely to churn.
  - Lack of streaming services (TV, movies, and online backup) correlates with increased churn.

- **Account-Related Insights:**
  - Customers with **technical issues** (raised tickets) are more likely to churn.
  - **Month-to-Month** contract holders have a significantly higher churn probability.
  - Higher-paying customers tend to have increased churn rates.

- **Demographic Insights:**
  - Customers **with partners** churn more often.
  - **Gender** does not significantly impact the churn rate.

### Recommendations:

- Promote streaming services to increase customer engagement and reduce churn.
- Address recurring technical issues to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Encourage customers to switch from **Month-to-Month** contracts to **long-term** plans.
- Investigate customer concerns through targeted surveys to understand the churn drivers better.

## üìû Task 2: Call Center Solution Dashboard

This dashboard was developed to assist PhoneNow's Call Center Manager in tracking and improving call center performance by monitoring customer satisfaction, call volume, and agent efficiency.

<img src="https://github.com/Gtshivanand/PwC-Switzerland---Power-BI-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Task%202/Images/Customer%20Risk%20Analysis.png"/>

### Key Insights:

- **Average Satisfaction Below Target:**
  - The current average satisfaction score is **3.40**, which falls short of the target of **4.5**.

- **Resolution and Answer Rates:**
  - **81.08%** of calls are answered, but the **first-call resolution rate** is only **72.92%**.

- **Speed of Answer:**
  - The **average speed to answer** is **67.52 seconds**, impacting overall customer satisfaction.

- **Agent Performance Variance:**
  - Differences in agent performance metrics suggest the need for targeted training and better monitoring.

### Recommendations:

- Conduct in-depth analysis to identify causes of **low customer satisfaction**.
- Improve the **first-call resolution rate** through better training and improved processes.
- Implement a **follow-up** mechanism for unresolved customer issues.
- Streamline the call-handling process to **reduce wait times** and improve response efficiency.

## üë• Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard

PwC Switzerland has been tasked to assist a telecom client in advancing gender balance within their executive management. Despite efforts, progress is stagnant, prompting a need for our expertise in diversity and inclusion, which we regard as essential for business success and innovation. The goal is to transform the inclusive culture into tangible results, addressing the practical hurdles to truly harness the benefits of a diverse workforce.

<img  src="https://github.com/Gtshivanand/PwC-Switzerland---Power-BI-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Task%203/Images/Employee%20Overview.png"/>

### Key Insights:

- *Representation Disparity:*
  - Women represent *only 25%* of new hires at the executive level.
  - Promotion rates for women decrease significantly beyond the *Manager* level.

- *Root Causes Identified:*
  - *Unconscious Bias*: Potential bias in hiring and promotion processes.
  - *Pipeline Issues*: Limited qualified female candidates for senior roles.
  - *Work-Life Balance*: Demanding roles may deter women from advancing.
  - *Retention*: Higher attrition rates for women in senior positions.

### Recommendations:

- Implement *bias training* to reduce unconscious bias in hiring and promotions.
- Establish *mentorship programs* to support women in advancing to leadership roles.
- Offer *flexible work arrangements* to improve work-life balance.
- Regularly review promotion criteria to ensure equity.
- Conduct *exit interviews* to understand and address the reasons for¬†attrition.
